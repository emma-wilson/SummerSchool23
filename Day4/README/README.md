## Seminar: Exploring "fishy" data - an adventure in multivariate statistics and the cult of J.W. Tukey
*Speaker: Sam Legget*

There is a lot of uncertainty in statistics with archaeology. 
Many statisticians are moving beyond using P-values.
In computational archaeology, P-values are generally unhelpful.

A new approach is exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
EDA is about being "actively incivise rather than passively descriptive".

Averages (and other summaty statistics) are not enough to understand your data. 
Different data can have similar summary statistics.

Sam's current research involves using meta-analysis to investigate how fish have been part of human diets. 
Sam uses data from human remains to understand historic diets.
Most people plot this data on two axes -- carbon on one axis and nitrogen on the other.
More recent analyses also include sulphur content to add a third dimension.
Analysis of where someone came from using water is difficult, as humans have throughout history bottled and imported drinks such as beer and wine.

Sam was able to use EDA to analyse her complex data.
Looking at postcranial bones to investigate later life diets, Sams data were hierachical and nested.
Using multivariate statistics, she was able to identify 3 distinct clusters in the data, which corresponded to 3 distinct diets.
Sam was able to use her data to suggest that there were possible adulthood fish eaters in England during the medieval period.
