## Seminar: Affective partisan sorting in the UK
*Speaker: Ugur Ozdemir*

Affective partisan polarisation (APP) is strong emotional attachments towards co-partisans and hostility towards opposing partisans.
APP can be measured through 'thermometer questions' in surveys, e.g. how much do you like or dislike the political parties.
APP has mainly been investigated in the context of American politics, but more recently APP has been investigated in the UK and Europe.

For two party systems, median distances are usually used to measure APP. 
However, the measurement is more complex in multiparty systems.
Each individual is a K-size vector rather than an single datapoint.

Ugar's work uses APP as a latent variable, and uses all the like/dislike information to construct a unidimensional 'affective partisanship space' (reduce NxK matrix to Nx1 matrix).
Using this method, Ugar has examined the poralisation dynamics of the UK electorate. 
If one single dimention explains everything (e.g. everyone who loves the Conservatives hates Labour), then we can infer polarisation.

Ugur looked at data from the British Election Study Internet Panel, from Feb 2014 - May 2022. 
Sample sizes were around 30,000. 
The questions asked followed the format of 'how much do you like / dislike the following party?'.
The dataset covers 'turbulent times', e.g. Scottish Independence, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
This gave Ugur an interesting opportunity to investigate if issue polarisation and affective polarisation are related.

Ugur found that issue polarisation is leading to affective partisan sorting, an turbulent times seemed to sharpen affective partisan divisions.
His future work will investigate different subgroups.
